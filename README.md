# How to run
To run this program, you must have Python set up in your machine.
1. Download or clone this respository.
2. Go to the project folder named "TrelloCardAutomation" or "TrelloCardAutomation-main", depending on how you chose to copy this file. 
3. Create a virtual environment and run it. If you have never made a virtual python environment, you may go through the following commands:
  1. Install the virtual environment libaray using pip with `python -m pip install virtualenv`
  2. Create a virtual environment (named "venv" in this case) with `python -m venv venv`. This will cause a folder named "venv" to be created in the project folder.
  3. Run the virtual environment with `ve\Scripts\activate.bat`.
  4. When you want to return to your regular command line environment, just enter the command `deactivate`
4. In your virtual library, install the required libraries by entering `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the application by clicking on the Automate Card - Shortcut.
